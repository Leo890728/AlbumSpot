            "<i><b>21</b></i> is the second studio album by British singer Adele. It was released on January 24, 2011 in most of Europe, and on February 22, 2011 in North America. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.",
            "Adele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channeling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.",
            "Praised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her indie record label XL Recordings. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history. It was certified Diamond by the RIAA and was ranked as the \"Greatest Billboard 200 Album of All Time.\"",
            "Five singles were released to promote the album, with \"Rolling in the Deep,\" \"Someone Like You,\" and \"Set Fire to the Rain\" becoming international number-one songs, while \"Rumour Has It\" charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America. Globally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalize lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. With 31 million copies sold worldwide, the album is one of the best-selling albums of all time. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year."

            "<i><b>19</b></i> is the debut studio album by British singer Adele. It was first released on January 28, 2008, through XL Recordings. Following Adele’s graduation from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in May 2006, she began publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on MySpace, where it became very successful and led to interest from XL Recordings. This led to Adele signing a recording contract with the label and providing vocals for Jack Peñate; during this session for Peñate’s song, Adele met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album.",
            "Adele wrote most of the album’s material solely, but did work with a select few writers and producers, including Jim Abbiss, Eg White, and Sacha Skarbek. Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with lyrics describing heartbreak and relationships. Upon release, 19 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the singer’s vocals and noting her as having the “potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.” 19 also won and was nominated for numerous accolades including a Mercury Prize, and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The second single, “Chasing Pavements,” also won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.",
            "19 was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the UK charts during its release, and peaking at number four on the US Billboard 200 in 2012. The album is certified 7× Platinum in the UK, and 3× Platinum in the US. Worldwide sales for the album are at an estimated 10 million copies."

Making up for everything I ever did and never did. But I haven't got time to hold on to the crumbs of my past like I used to. What's done is done. Turning 25 was a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my twenties. Teetering on the edge of being an adolescent and a fully-fledged adult. I made the decision to go into becoming who I'm going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk. I miss everything about my past, the good and the bad, but only because it won't come back. When I was in it I wanted out! So typical. I'm on about being a teenager, sitting around and chatting shit, not caring about the future because it didn't matter then like it does now. The ability to be flippant about everything and there be no consequences. Even following and breaking rules... is better than making the rules. 25 is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.",

            "25 is the third studio album recorded by Adele. It was released on November 20, 2015 through XL Recordings. Following the release and international success of Adele's second studio album 21 (2011), she had considered quitting the music industry and going out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015. According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.",
            "Titled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old, 25 is a \"make-up record.\" The album's lyrical content features themes of Adele \"yearning for her old self, her nostalgia,\" and \"melancholia about the passage of time,\" according to an interview with Adele by Rolling Stone, as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous work, the production of 25 incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s R&B and organs. Like 21, Adele collaborated with producer and songwriter Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder, along with new collaborations with Max Martin and Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Danger Mouse, the Smeezingtons, Samuel Dixon, and Tobias Jesso Jr.",
            "25 received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended Adele's vocal performance. The album achieved commercial success by debuting at number one in more than 25 markets and broke first-week sales records in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and United States; in the US, the album sold 3.38 million copies in its first week of release, marking the largest single-week sales for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991. A month after its release, the album had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Many journalists regarded the album as having an impact on the music industry by encouraging the public to return to buying physical albums, instead of downloading or streaming.",
            "Following 21, it was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of ten million copies in the United States, making Adele the only artist of the 2010s to achieve this certification with two albums. Many journalists felt that the album impacted the music industry by encouraging the public to return to buying physical albums, instead of downloading or streaming. 25 received the Brit Award for British Album of the Year, while the lead single \"Hello\" won British Single of the Year. The album then won the 2017 Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. \"Hello\" also won Grammys for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance."

            "30 is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele, released on November 19, 2021 by Melted Stone and Columbia Records. Serving as the follow-up album to her 2015 release, 25, it was originally expected to be released in September 2020, but was delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by Adele’s divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki, the album explores themes of separation, motherhood and the scrutiny of fame. Adele wrote the album between 2018 and 2021 with various producers, including Greg Kurstin, Tobias Jesso Jr., Max Martin and Shellback, all of whom she worked with on 25; new collaborators on 30 include Ludwig Göransson and Inflo.",
            "The lead single, “Easy On Me,” was released on October 15, 2021 to international success. 30 has been advertised using an extensive promotional campaign, which included a CBS concert special titled Adele One Night Only featuring an interview segment by American talk show host Oprah Winfrey, followed by an ITV concert special titled An Audience with Adele. She also served as one of the headliners of British Summer Time Hyde Park on July 1 and 2, 2022 to promote the album.",
            "Upon release, the album received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, who commended its cinematic instrumentation and strong vocal performances, and dubbed its subject matter as Adele’s most honest yet. 30 has been described as a record of pop, jazz and soul ballads focusing on romantic but melancholic themes of heartache, acceptance, and hope. American jazz pianist Erroll Garner is posthumously credited as a featured artist on the track “All Night Parking,” marking the first guest act on a standard album by Adele."

The album was originally announced as Daydreamin', but the title was ultimately changed before release. This was the album's title up until at least March 19, 2013.",

Grande was inspired by several artists throughout the making of Yours Truly, including Amy Winehouse, Christina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey. The album was crafted over the span of nearly three years with various producers, including Harmony Samuels, Babyface, Patrick \"J. Que\" Smith, and Victorious co-star, Leon Thomas III of the Rascals, creating a sound that is, in Grande's words, \"half-throwback, half-unique.\"",

The album achieved critical acclaim upon release and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).",

Grande served as the album's executive producer alongside Max Martin and Savan Kotecha. Guest vocals on the album are provided by Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Macy Gray and Future. The album was originally going to be titled Moonlight until ultimately being changed in January, 2016.",
            "Lyrically, Dangerous Woman takes on a more mature theme in contrast to Grande's previous efforts, revolving around love, sex, rebelliousness, destructive relationships, and self-pleasure. An eclectic record, the album incorporates, EDM, disco, house, trap, hip-hop, reggae-pop, electropop, and new jack swing. The album was received positively by critics, many of whom praised Grande's powerful vocals, matured lyrical content, and ability to adapt to many different musical styles. Others felt the album was consistent, but not cohesive.",

Sweetener was created between June 2016 and July 2018 and explores themes of womanhood, romance, unhealthy relationships, anxiety, and perseverance.",

            "Three singles were released from the album, two of which debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. With this, Thank U, Next joined Daydream by Mariah Carey as the only albums by female artists to have multiple songs debut at number one. Grande also joined Carey and Britney Spears as the only female artists with multiple number-one debuts; overall she is the fifth artist after Justin Bieber and Drake. Topping charts in many countries internationally, the song broke numerous streaming records, including the record for the most streams received by a song in a single day for a female artist on Spotify, and the largest on-demand streaming week ever recorded for a female artist in the US."

            "Positions (commonly abbreviated as PST or POS) is the sixth studio album by American singer Ariana Grande. It was released on October 30, 2020, by Republic Records. Centering on themes of romantic devotion, healing of the inner-self, physical attraction, and combating negativity, Positions sonically expands on the trap-infused R&B and pop first seen in its highly acclaimed predecessors, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019). Strings are present on the majority of the songs featured on the album. Used to sonically tie the album together, the strings contrast to the trap beats to provide a timeless-yet-modern feel.",
            "Upon release, Positions was met with generally favorable reviews from critics and fans alike. Grande's vocals were universally praised, though the album's production split listeners. A commercial success, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Grande's third consecutive, and fifth overall album to do so.",
            "On February 19, 2021, a deluxe version of the album was released with five new tracks, including a remix of \"34+35\" featuring American rappers Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat. Following the deluxe's release, Positions achieved more chart success, climbing back into the top 5 of the US Billboard 200."

            "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (stylized in all caps) is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Billie Eilish. It was released on March 29, 2019, by Darkroom and Interscope Records in the US and Polydor Records in the UK. Eilish, aged 17 at the time of release, largely wrote the album with her brother Finneas O'Connell, who produced it at his small bedroom studio in Highland Park, Los Angeles.",
            "Musically, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? is a pop, electropop, avant-pop, and art pop record, though it also features influences from hip hop and industrial music. Its songs explore themes such as modern youth, drug addiction, heartbreak, suicide, and mental health, with lyrical sensibilities of humor and horror. The album's title comes from a line in the song \"Bury a Friend\". Eilish said the album was inspired in part by lucid dreaming and night terrors, which are reflected on the cover photo.",
            "The album was marketed with the release of seven singles, four of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US—\"You Should See Me in a Crown\", \"When the Party's Over\", \"Bury a Friend\", and the worldwide hit \"Bad Guy\". Eilish also embarked on several tours in support of the album, including the When We All Fall Asleep Tour and the Where Do We Go? World Tour. An immediate commercial success, the album topped record charts in many countries during its first week of release. By June 2019, it had sold more than 1.3 million copies in the US and became the year's best-selling album in Canada, while in the UK, it had made Eilish the youngest female solo act to chart at number one.",
            "Upon release, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? received universal acclaim and was one of the year's most acclaimed albums. Many reviewers praised its subject matter, songwriting, cohesiveness, and Eilish's vocal styling. At the 2020 Grammy Awards, it won Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while \"Bad Guy\" won Record of the Year and Song of the Year; Finneas also won the award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. In 2020, the album was ranked at 397 on \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list."

            "In the Lonely Hour is the debut studio album by English singer and songwriter Sam Smith. It was released in the United Kingdom on 26 May 2014 via Capitol UK and Method Records. In the United States, it was released on 17 June 2014 through Capitol Records America. The album includes the hit singles \"Money on My Mind\" and \"Stay with Me\", both of which were number one in the UK; the latter becoming a hit worldwide, peaking in the top ten in over 20 countries, including reaching number two in the US. The album's third hit single, \"I'm Not the Only One\", reached number three in the UK and number five in the US. A deluxe edition of the album contains five bonus tracks, including a solo acoustic version of Disclosure's single \"Latch\" and Naughty Boy's number-one single \"La La La\", on both of which Smith provided guest vocals.",
            "Upon its release, In the Lonely Hour received mostly lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom praised Smith's vocal performance but were critical of the songwriting. The album was a commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It was the second-best-selling album of 2014 in the UK, and the third-best-selling of 2014 in the United States. It was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter and losing to Morning Phase by Beck in the former. In the Lonely Hour also received a nomination for Best British Album at the 2015 Brit Awards; the accolade ultimately went to Ed Sheeran for x.",
            "The album was re-released in November 2015 as In the Lonely Hour (Drowning Shadows Edition), which features 12 new tracks, including the Disclosure single \"Omen\" (which features vocals from Smith), the Comic Relief version of \"Lay Me Down\" featuring John Legend, and covers of Whitney Houston's \"How Will I Know\" and Amy Winehouse's \"Love Is a Losing Game\"."

            "Love Goes is the third studio album by English singer and songwriter Sam Smith. It was released on 30 October 2020 through Capitol Records. The album serves as a follow-up to Smith's second studio album The Thrill of It All (2017). The album was originally planned to be titled To Die For and was due for release on 1 May 2020 but was delayed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith also felt it was insensitive to use the word \"die\" due to what many people were going through. The album won a GLAAD Media Award in the Outstanding Music Artist category in April 2021."

            "Taylor Swift is the eponymous debut studio album by American country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. After signing a record deal in 2005, the album was released on October 24, 2006, through Big Machine Records. Most of the writing took place during Swift's freshman year of high school. Swift wrote or co-wrote every song on Taylor Swift; most co-written songs feature Liz Rose as a writer. Swift experimented to record the album with several album producers, ultimately choosing the producer of her demo album, Nathan Chapman. Musically, the album is styled to blend country music and pop music and lyrically, it speaks of romantic relationships, a couple of which Swift wrote from observing relationships before being in one.",
            "Taylor Swift was received positively by contemporary critics, who praised Swift's talent. The album enjoyed commercial success; in the United States, it peaked at number five on the Billboard 200, topped the Top Country Albums Chart for twenty-four non-consecutive weeks, and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Taylor Swift marked the longest stay on the Billboard 200 by any album released in the decade. It also charted in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.",
            "Five singles were released from the album, all of which were certified platinum by the RIAA. \"Tim McGraw\" was released as the lead single from Taylor Swift; it became a top ten on Billboard's Hot Country Songs. \"Teardrops On My Guitar\" was released as the second single from Taylor Swift, becoming the best-charting song from Taylor Swift on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Our Song\" was released as the third single from the album and became Swift's first number-one on Hot Country Songs. \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\" were released as the fourth single and fifth single from the album, respectively, both becoming a success on the country-genre charts in the United States and later peaking at number eighteen on the New Zealand Singles Chart. Swift promoted Taylor Swift by performing at several venues, which included her opening for Rascal Flatts, George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill."

            "Fearless is the second studio album by American recording artist, Taylor Swift. The album was released on November 11, 2008, through Big Machine Records. As with her first album, Taylor Swift, Swift wrote or co-wrote all thirteen tracks of Fearless. Most of the songs were written as the singer promoted her first album as the opening act for numerous country artists. Due to the unavailability of collaborators on the road, eight songs were written by Swift. Other songs were co-written with Liz Rose, Hillary Lindsey, Colbie Caillat and John Rich. Swift also made her debut as a record producer, co-producing all songs on the album with Nathan Chapman.",
            "Five singles were released from Fearless. The first single, \"Love Story\", sold more than 8.1 million copies worldwide (according to the IFPI).[1] It was a crossover hit that became one of the best-selling singles of all time internationally and was once the best-selling country song of all time. The succeeding single, \"White Horse\", also performed well in the US. \"You Belong with Me\" was an international success, becoming Swift's second best-selling single and her highest position on the US Billboard Hot 100 at the time. \"Fifteen\" and \"Fearless\" followed with both achieving a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).",
            "Fearless was an international breakthrough and huge commercial success for Swift. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, and later became the best-selling album of 2009, selling over 3.2 million copies. It gave Swift, 18 at the time, the distinction of being the youngest artist in history to have the year's best-selling album. It has sold over 7 million copies in the United States.[2] Fearless topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand and achieved multi-platinum status in six countries. In all, Fearless has sold more than 9,7 million copies worldwide as of December 2017.[3] Fearless is also the most awarded album in the history of country music, winning Album of the Year at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, the American Music Awards of 2009, the Country Music Association Awards and the Academy of Country Music Awards. Winning Album of the Year at age 20, Swift became the youngest artist in the history of the Grammy Awards to win the award. She would later win her second Album of the Year six years later.[4] On December 11, 2017, Fearless became the 121st album to achieve a diamond certification in the United States, signifying 10,000,000 album-equivalent units.[5] To promote the album, Swift embarked on her first concert tour, Fearless Tour between April 2009 and June 2010."

            "Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 25, 2010, through Big Machine Records. Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2010 at several recording studios, and was handled by Swift and Nathan Chapman. Written entirely by Swift as the follow-up to Fearless (2008), Speak Now blends the country-pop of her early work with a big pop-rock production style and features lyrical themes concerning love, romance and heartbreak. A deluxe edition was released on the same day exclusively to US Target stores; it contained three extra bonus tracks and two acoustic versions as well as a pop remix of \"Mine\". Internationally, another deluxe edition was released containing the same three bonus songs and acoustic songs, and three US versions. In 2012, the Target exclusive was released to a wider distribution in the US.",
            "Speak Now received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Swift's songwriting and themes. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling approximately 1,047,000 units in its first week. Due to strong digital sales, all fourteen songs from the standard edition of the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100, with the lead single \"Mine\" having the highest peak of number three. Six singles were released from the album, including the US Country number-one hits \"Sparks Fly\" and \"Ours\". Speak Now was also an international success, charting within the top 10 in several countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.",
            "Swift promoted the album with an international tour, Speak Now World Tour, throughout 2011. According to Swift's label Big Machine Records, as of September 2011, Speak Now has sold over 5.8 million copies worldwide.[1] The album has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of October 2012, has sold 4.2 million copies in the United States."

            "After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor's Version[a] after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).",
            "One of the world's best-selling musicians, Swift has sold over 200 million records as of 2019. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. Six of her albums have opened with over one million sales in a week. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards; she has won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year a record four times each."
